无聊冷知识

你是否知道“盐鸭蛋也可以用鸡蛋制成，尽管名字不同，但口味和质地会有所不同，蛋黄也不会那么丰富”。 ([Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg))

Did you know that "despite its name, salted duck eggs can also be made from
chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the
egg yolk will be less rich."?
